# Tweet!

Hi there and welcome to Tweet! A realtime tweet to map application.

## About 

This project was for the 2017 UIowa Bigdata Hackathon. It was created in under 36hours, and under the influence of many Red Bulls

## Things we learned

On the back end of things we learned a lot about creating our own API as a personalization of the Twitter API.

On the front end we learned a lot about flask before recognizing ReactJs as a better option.
